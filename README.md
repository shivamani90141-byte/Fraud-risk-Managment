# Fraud-risk-Managment
Built a database-driven system to detect fraudulent transactions using rule-based analysis. Designed a normalized relational database for customer, transaction, and device data. Used SQL to identify high-risk transactions based on amount, location, and device behavior, and generated reports using Python in CSV and Excel formats.
